**Abstract**: This paper introduces a multimodal dual-stream recommendation model for microwave oven dishes, which not only solves user's confusion in choosing microwave dishes, but also accurately distinguishes their preferences and comprehensively understands needs. The model includes recommendation and dialogue modules, and utilizes comparative learning to improve recommendation accuracy. In recommendation module, we propose an attention-based implicit semantic recommendation model to distinguish user's preferences for different dishes and obtain more accurate recommendation results than existing models. In dialog module, we introduce the MSIM-SOG model to extract user's personalized needs. Finally, we design a multimodal fusion mechanism to achieve dual-stream recommendation by multimodal fusion of recommendation and dialogue model for the recommendation modal information of user's historical data and the demand modal information of user's special needs. Through comparative experiments and multi-level system tests, the robustness and effectiveness of the model in this paper are verified, and it has great application value.

**Key words**：Latent Factor Model, Multimodal Fusion, Dual-stream Recommendation, Contrastive Learning, Microwave oven dishes Recommendation System
